# Movie Finder

## About the App

The primary function of this app is to demonstrate skills in developing for mobile with React Native, as well as in interacting with RESTful APIs.

### Features
- Search for movies by title
- Return a list of movies matching search query, displaying title, release year and rating at a glance
- Tap poster image for larger view
- Tap title to open description
- Tap Google icon to initiate Google search of this movie title for further information
- Rating turns red when below 5.0 to alert user that this is a bad movie

### Edge cases handled
- Returns message when no results found
- Subs "N/A" when no rating found
- Returns message when no description found
- Provides fallback image when no poster found

### UI Niceties
- Loading Activity Indicators when fonts and results are being loaded
- Tap X to clear search quickly
- Debouncing to reduce constant calls to API slowing down responsiveness

### Improvements I would make with more time on this project
- Figure out pagination to return more than one page worth of results or enable user to access subsequent pages of data (it's currently only ever returning 20 movies)
- Add navigation to separate pages instead of using modals to expand information
- Improve visual UI in general (feels pretty cluttered at the moment)
- Enable users to filter data by rating, release date, etc.

### About the API

The Movie Database [TMBD API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) is a popular, user editable database for movies and TV shows.Â The API is free as long as credit is attributed per requirements, addressed in footer of this app.
